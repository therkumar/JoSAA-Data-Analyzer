# JoSAA-Data-Analyzer
This project can help you help analyze opening and closing ranks for varoius colleges in India. It will help in choice filling your counselling next year when you need to order college based on your ranks.
Here is a bit more explanation about this.
1. Context and Problem Statement:
•	Background: Every year, around 2 million students take the JEE exam and use the JoSAA portal to determine their college preferences based on opening and closing ranks.
•	Problem: The JoSAA portal requires students to spend considerable time searching for trends in previous years' data, and it offers limited filtering options, making it cumbersome to compare multiple criteria simultaneously.
2. Project Objective:
•	Solution: To address this issue, I created a user-friendly Excel interface that allows students to filter and analyze opening and closing ranks based on multiple criteria simultaneously, which the JoSAA portal does not offer. My tool also works offline, providing additional convenience.
